To create such datastore which would handle the given amount of users data and answer the queries or requests
it would be good option to use a Relational Data Base. A RDBMS synchornizes and stores the user information 
in tables with connection between every table, hence it becomes easy to access the required data in limited time.

The internal implementation of these tables include row based parsing and validation. SQL queries are written
to access and update data values from the RDBMS. The time-complexity of the operations depends on the amount of 
data. Usually the time-complexity in best case is O(nlog(n)) and worst case is O(n^2).

In order to get the API with maximum response time among users and maximum response for user the timestamp feature
can be used and the response time can be calculated. Since, RDBMS show ACID(Atomicity, Concurrency, Integrity, Data-Depedency)
properties there is very less or no scope of error.
